# FP8 - Final Report

For your final report:

* Each student must individually create a report.
* The report is a file in your project repository.
* The file must be named "```FIRST_LAST.md```". Make sure to uppercase your name and use an underscore between
your first and last name.
* The report should provide an overview of your project, and then narrate your own code contributions.
* You must highlight ***how your code embodies the ideas of the course***.
* Your report should name and briefly describe any libraries or external technology used.
* Focus on your own contributions to the project.
* Please see [Analysis](https://github.com/oplS17projects/FP4-Proposal/blob/master/template.md "analysis section")
for discussion of what to highlight.
* See [this example](https://github.com/fgmart/google-drive-racket/blob/master/FRED_MARTIN.md "Fred's writeup example") of what a report might look like. *You should study this example and copy its structure.*
* You should highlight three to five code excerpts.

Make it clear who wrote the code that you are highlighting. Ideally it's your code. But if you are writing about your
partner's code, say so.
